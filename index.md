Welcome! I am a PhD student in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Berkeley. My research sits at the intersection of environmental economics and development, and I get excited about pretty much anything related to sustainable water management. I especially enjoy combining empirical work with tools from trade to answer questions that have a spatial dimension.

Here you can find some fast information about me; for my full CV see the link above.
