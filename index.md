Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Berkeley. My research sits at the intersection of environmental economics and development, and I especially enjoy combining empirical work with tools from trade and economic geography to answer questions that have a spatial dimension.

Here you can find some fast information about me; for my full CV see the link above.
