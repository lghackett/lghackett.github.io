Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Berkeley. I am an environmental economist interested in topics of economic development and urban/spatial economics. I especially enjoy combining empirical work with tools from trade and economic geography to answer questions that have a spatial dimension.

Here you can find some fast information about me; for my full CV see the link above.

_I am on the 2025-2026 job market._
