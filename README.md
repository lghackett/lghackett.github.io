# Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter

This site uses the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). Replace sample content with your own and [configure as necessary](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/).

## Troubleshooting


- [Ruby 101](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/)
- [Setting up a Jekyll site with GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)
- [Configuring GitHub Metadata](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configuration) to work properly when developing locally and avoid `No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.` warnings.

To use on a new computed, install with:

```
bundle

```

To update changes and see locally, run:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
